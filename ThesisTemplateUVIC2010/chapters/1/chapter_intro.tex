Many network application vulnerabilities occur not just in one application, but in how they interact with other systems. These kinds of vulnerabilities can be difficult to analyze. Dual-trace analysis is one approach that helps the security engineers to detect the vulnerabilities in the interactive software. A dual-trace consist of two execution traces that are generated from two interacting applications. Each of these traces contains information including CPU instructions, register and memory changes of the running application. Communication information of the interacting applications is captured as the register or memory changes on their respective sides. Our research focuses on building a model to visualize and analyze dual-trace which would be available for various kinds of communication type.
