Read Windows symbol files to associate names with functions.
Make assembly trace shown by thread.
Add flags register.
Bug - Registers and Memory views refer to 0 indexed line numbers
Bug - RSI and ESI differ even though both changed?
Change/add a hex view (like visual studio) for memory. Have highlighting and copying.
Currently the BigFileViewer calls update text widget whenever a region is marked as expanded.  this should probably be changed to modifyannotation is called instead.
When I collapse a region that includes the last line of the file, it occasionally doesn't update the view and so all empty lines are shown.  Upon scrolling this is fixed, and there is no difference between our tracker and theirs.
Bug - Visualization - view sync between visualizations and editors, not obvious what line is selected in the editor
Bug - Visualization - sync from editor to viz does not work
Bug - Comments - Can't have a return line in the comment body?
Bug - Memory View - Search does not see 00010000 and 10000 as equilivant
Bug - Memory usage increases as the user navigates through file
Bug - Line numbers not showing when turned on
Bug - Memory View - Error when you click on the aggregate button
Bug - Regions - New regions not displayed if closing and re-opening a trace file
Bug - Memory View - "Jump To" is off by a few lines
Bug - Regions - Big regions work, but scrolling is initally slow and then gets faster

Upgrade Atlantis to use new data format
1) Allow non *.trace to *show* visualizations (already parses!) [new issue]
2) Ensure memory results are still good overall [was ok, now bugged]
3) Parse new thread format [adapt to new id format, lack of explicit Switch statements]
4) Highlighting for new thread format [new issue]
5) See if syscalls involved [syntax highlighting only, no vis connections, so it's fine]

Bug - Entering just the database name does not change DB settings
Creating and collapsing a region at the end of the file breaks.
I occasionally experience the situation where I add a region to a file that is contained in another region, however, it does not get added as a child.  This causes breaking region collapses.
Syntax highlighting is throwing exceptions when it is looking at offsets when the document text is changed.
There may be a way to re-do the memory indexing stuff.  By simply assigning ids to the nodes in the tree such that they correspond to indices in an array (which is designed to store a tree, which I need to look up how to do), it is likely feasible that we could simply use math to determine the necessary indices, and thus ids, that we would need to query for a given line.
Projection Document has a DefaultLineTracker, which is eating up a ton of memory.  We should rewrite the tracker to fix this.
Enable 'Cancel' button when indexing trace files

Bug - Tag navigation buttons don't navigate between tag instances
Bug - Memory view search for address does not work
Bug - Memory View search not working
Bug - Tag name edits affect same-named tag grouping title, but not actual other tags until the trace is re-opened
Tag/comment editing doesn't apply until restart. Need to update all tag/comment instances.
Cannot edit regions
Can't make parent regions around existing regions
Jump-to-line fails to take us into collapsed regions (inc memory jump to)
Comment and tag overlay checkboxes lead to exceptions near top of file when comments are tags are also nearby (line 8)
Bug - Jump To feature not working in Watched Memory View
Index and tmp not getting created properly
The 5G file is having issues loading later in the file, it is throwing a Negative seek offset IOException
The DB schema is only supporting numbers up to MAXINT size, need to convert them all to BigInt, which supports big enough values.
Syntax highlighting is a little slow in Atlantis since the tracker change.  Find out why and fix it, it may require caching results.
Sometimes queries to the memory delta table take ~3s, as we found while benchmarking.  After some investigation we discovered that the querying engine was deciding not to use the index.  We need to change queries from the memory delta index to force use the index.
The Document class that we use to hold the text uses a DefaultLineTracker (which contains a TreeLineTracker), and this thing uses a TON of RAM. Considering we build this index anyways, we might as well just re-write the Document
URGENT: I believe that we can make queries go order of magnitudes faster if we combine multiple inserts into one actual query.
The Database config stuff is getting overwritten even if the database info in the preferences is empty
We should see if we can implement syntax highlighting using the standard eclipse extension points, as this would clean up our code a lot.
The line number column does not show itself when you click the show line numbers menu option until you reopen a trace file.
Task - Split Big File Viewer and Atlantis Projects
Syntax Highligting of annotations adds a syntax highlighting all the way to the end of the annotations last line, instead of stopping at the correct offset.
the line numbers are displaying a little bit weird since we re-implemented the projection and editor stuff.  Figure out why and fix.
Opening an empty file throws an Exception.
Search not returning any results in Atlantis but is returning results in BFV.  Figure out why and fix.
Tag Annotation squiggly underlines look like they are not getting drawn properly
It doesn't look like Tag annotations are being drawn in the incorrect location.  A modelLine2WidgetLine conversion may be needed.
syntax highlighting manager is duplicated across the traceViewer and the TraceDisplayer
Currently the BFV cannot handle anything but trace files, and it will break if you try to open any file that doesn't end in .trace.
I created a region that spanned the entire document, and got an InvalidLocationException.  This is probably related to regions that include the last line of the file.
If you create a tag annotation that starts or ends in a collapsed region it will break when trying to draw the style if the region is collapsed.
The BFV is breaking when attempting to open java files, because despite the fact that it is opening them using the java editor, it is still looking in .tmp for the empty file.
It looks like the BFV breaks really badly when we switch to the Java perspective and try to do content assist.

Bug? Region tool tips contain region text. If this is big...do we have a problem?
Bug - Overlap region warning prevents creation of outer regions after making the inner region.
Bug - Region Context Menu: Edit window does not commit changes
Bug - Sticky tooltip comment bubble is not removed when comments are unselected/removed. Sticky tooltips for other things probably have the same problem
Bug - Two copies of Atlantis cannot run simultaneously with different DB settings

Bug - Trace Visualization y-scroll flickers.
Bug: Trace visualization isn't drawn when an execution trace loads
Bug - Selecting text across block boundaries
If you switch from A000000 to test.trace, the assembly view's scrolling is really slow for a bit.
Bug - Editor fails to load if Hex highlight preference turned off
Bug - Hex value highlighting feature not working
Bug - Switching between traces a whole bunch uses up too many DB connections.
Bug - Syntax highlighting constantly throws Concurrant Modification Exceptions.  it should be changed to run in the UI thread.
Bug - Memory Visualization View not centering correctly.
People installing our plugin will likely get out of memory errors, unless they manually change the max memory size in their eclispe.ini.  Is there anyway that we can do this manually?
