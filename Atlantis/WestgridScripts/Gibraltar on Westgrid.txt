Running Gibraltar on Westgrid

Large traces (bigger than, say, 40GB) are slow to run on normal computers (in 2017), and very large traces (634GB, for example)
have heap memory demands that lead to out of heap errors when run on a multi-purpose development system. Gibraltar needs
more RAM.

Westgrid has two systems, Cedar and Graham, that are suitable for our purposes.

Temporarily using Nestor/Hermes systems. These are limited to /home/username at 300GB, /global/scratch/username at 1TB,
and /scratch at 225GB for the node's specific scratch space. When possible, I guess we use /scratch with priority
over /global/scratch? Also note that /scratch can be accessed via $TMPDIR. On Hermes, maybe only the output
of Gibraltar will go in /scratch, while the trace may be read from /global/scratch.



Get a Compute Canada account (and a Westgrid account?). You'll need to go through Peggy or your PI to do so.

Connect to Cedar (or Graham) through ssh/putty.
Use Globus to move files where you need them.
Or...well, the ports are all closed here, so let's use SFTP unless there's a good reason not to.

WinSCP sends 40GB in about 3 hours.


Use scripts to run Gibraltar, and to move the Sqlite DB file out of temporary disk space.

TORQUE, with .pbs files, for moving stuff around and running Gibraltar.
