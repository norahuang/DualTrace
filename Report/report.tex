\section{Introduction}
Many network application vulnerabilities occur not just in one application, but in how they interact with other systems. These kinds of vulnerabilities can be difficult to analyze. Dual-trace analysis is one approach that helps the security engineers to detect the vulnerabilities in the interactive software. A dual-trace consist of two execution traces that are generated from two interacting applications. Each of these traces contains information including CPU instructions, register and memory changes of the running application. Communication information of the interacting applications is captured as the register or memory changes on their respective sides. Our research focuses on building a model to visualize and analyze dual-trace which would be available for various kinds of communication methods such as UDP, TCP and named pipe. 

\subsection{Problem}
The major problem in dual-trace analysis is synchronization of the traces from both sides. We narrow down the problem into finding the sending points and receiving points of the communication messages and pair them. 

\subsection{solution}

\section{Prototype Building}
In this section we discuss the design of the prototype on how we match the send and receive events in the sender side trace and the receiver side trace. This prototype consist of three main components: defining the communication type, locating the communication events by matching the send and receive events on sender and receiver sides, navigating the located events in the sender and receiver traces. We provide the background information of the design of each component as well as its detail design in each corresponding subsection.
\subsection{User Defined Communication Type}
In our design, we don't specify any predefined communication type but give the user capacity to do that. By the user interface implemented in our tool, the user can defined their own communication type. This give the flexibility to the user to define what they are looking for. Each communication type consist of 4 system function calls. They are sender and receiver channel create/open, sender's send message function and receiver's receive message function. By indicating these the channel create/open function in both sender and receiver sides, the tool can acquire the channel's identifiers when they are created or opened. Later on the tool can match the send and received messages within a specific channel. The send and receive are used to located the event happened in the traces. The messages send and received are reconstructed from the memory state when the send and receive functions are called and returned. This detail of the match algorithm will be discuss later.
\subsubsection{Assembly Calling Convention}
To defined the communication type, users have to know the basic calling convention of the system call. 
Calling Convention is different for operating system and the programming language. Our prototype only be tested on traces of Microsoft 64 with C/C++ program. It seems too specific, however, the prototype can be adapted easily to other conventions. As long as users know the calling convention of their operating system, they can define their communication type with our tool. We list the related Microsoft 64 with C/C++ program convention here for reference and example. For more detail about the calling convention, user should refer to the operating system specification.\par
For the Microsoft* x64 calling convention, the additional register space let fastcall be the only calling convention (under x86 there were many: stdcall, thiscall, fastcall, cdecl, etc.). The rules for interfacing with C/C++ style functions:\par
\begin{enumerate}  
\item RCX, RDX, R8, R9 are used for integer and pointer arguments in that order left to right.
\item XMM0, 1, 2, and 3 are used for floating point arguments.
\item Additional arguments are pushed on the stack left to right. \ldots 
\item Parameters less than 64 bits long are not zero extended; the high bits contain garbage.
\item It is the caller's responsibility to allocate 32 bytes of "shadow \item space" (for storing RCX, RDX, R8, and R9 if needed) before calling the function.
\item It is the caller's responsibility to clean the stack after the call.
\item Integer return values (similar to x86) are returned in RAX if 64 bits or less.
\item Floating point return values are returned in XMM0.
\item Larger return values (structs) have space allocated on the stack by the caller, and RCX then contains a pointer to the return space when the callee is called. Register usage for integer parameters is then pushed one to the right. RAX returns this address to the caller.
\item The stack is 16-byte aligned. The "call" instruction pushes an 8-byte return value, so the all non-leaf functions must adjust the stack by a value of the form 16n+8 when allocating stack space.
\item Registers RAX, RCX, RDX, R8, R9, R10, and R11 are considered volatile and must be considered destroyed on function calls.
\item RBX, RBP, RDI, RSI, R12, R14, R14, and R15 must be saved in any function using them.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Basic Communication Methods}
We investigate two basic communication methods in the windows platform. The result are list in table \ref{communicatemethod}

\subsubsection{System Call in the Traces}
In the trace, we can get the called functions' name by importing the executable files in the functions view in Atlantis. All function calls in the trace will be listed in the functions views. User can add a specify function call in to a communication type view.
\subsubsection{Communication Type View}
A new view named MessageType view is added for the user defined communication types. User can import the dll file to the functions view in order to get the function names of the system calls. In the functions view, user can click on the function, in the prompt menu, there is a new action call "Add to message Type". By selecting this action, the user will get  a dialogue which ask for further information, such as Message type name, function type, related register information. Fig\ref{algorithm} should the function view actions and the prompt dialogue. For each message type, users have to add all 4 system function calls to make a full message type. Otherwise further search on this type will not match any message.
The added message types as well as they consisted functions are shown in the message type view. Searching of the match message occurrences is conducted by right click on the selected message type and choose "" in the menu. The matched messages are listed in the sub window of the view. By clicking the entry of the search  result, user can navigate to it's sender or receiver's corresponding instruction line. Message content in the memory view will be shown as well.
