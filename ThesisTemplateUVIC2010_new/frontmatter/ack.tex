\item[My parents, Jianhong Huang and Yuqun Liu,] 
	for their ceaseless and unconditional love, and for always believing in me.

%\textit{I believe I know the only cure, which is to make
%one's centre of life inside of one's self, not
%selfishly or excludingly, but with a kind of
%unassailable serenity-to decorate one's inner house
%so richly that one is content there, glad to welcome
%any one who wants to come and stay, but hapSpy all
%the same in the hours when one is inevitably alone.}
